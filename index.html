                You've probably guessed that my name is Shady Amr. Well you're right. I'm an Egyptian based computer programmer that slams code into a computer and magical things appear on screen. I have a huge passion for the web & apps.
                <br><br>
                I've been making websites since the age of 10 and haven't lost interest since then I started creating applications and scripts at the age of 13. I first got interested in making websites when I started using Weebly but I got very engrossed in it and wanted to learn how websites are manually built, so I did so by visiting other websites and viewing the source codes and figuring out how they worked.

                This website is under construction since I will be creating a new and better responsive portfolio from scratch. You can listen to my favorite playlist on YouTube down below.
